# The following script is meant to be use to perform the different functionnal analysis on data about Abundances of differents species classifed in different groups based on their functional traits.
# To work properly, the script need to be in the same folder as the data file and this script and the one that contain the functions need to be in the same folder. 

#### Data Importation ####

#### Data PreProcessing ####
##### Functionnal Space #####
